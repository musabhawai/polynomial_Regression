# Polynomial Regression – Salary Prediction by Position

## 📌 Overview
This repository demonstrates the use of *Polynomial Regression* to predict salary based on position level in a company.  
We explore how changing the polynomial degree affects the model’s ability to fit the data.

## 📖 About Polynomial Regression
Polynomial Regression is a type of regression analysis where the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is modeled as an nth degree polynomial.  
It is especially useful when data shows a *non-linear trend*.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
